We were also incharge in doing the static and dynamic analysis of code using coverity tool
There were many instances when we had to use open source code scanning methodologies like asana ,protex etc. for rapid code solution .
Basically , this project is based on content management system using Drupal as their CMS system .They are using PHP as their language .
We have also used Puppet scripts to automate the deployment .

As per Devops perspective, we were working under Agile framework .
From our product owner point of view, our main objective was to dockerize each and every component which Navigation uses to do the tasks.
